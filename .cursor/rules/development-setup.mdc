# Development Setup

This is a Lerna-managed monorepo. **Always use the Makefile commands** for dependency management.

## Cleaning Dependencies

Use `make clean` to clean node_modules and temporary files:
- Removes all `node_modules` directories
- Cleans Lerna packages with `lerna clean`
- Removes temporary files, build artifacts, and unnecessary config files from packages
- Cleans `dist`, `tmp`, and other build directories

## Installing Dependencies

Use `make setup` to install dependencies:
- Runs `npm install` to set up the monorepo correctly
- Properly configures all Lerna-managed packages

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually run `npm install`, `npm ci`, or other npm commands without using the Makefile. This may not properly configure the Lerna workspace.

## Other Available Commands

- `make serve` - Start the development server (with Fastboot disabled)
- `make version` - Version packages using Lerna
- `make publish` - Publish packages to npm
- `make deploy` - Deploy to production

Reference @Makefile for the complete list of available commands.
